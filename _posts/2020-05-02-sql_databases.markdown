SQL databases are based on a very basic and easy to understand concept that I will explain below.

In my previous job as head of talent acquisition, I had to handle a lot of data and report, and my only tool was Excel. It took me a long time to gather the information and put it in order for the pivot tables to do their job. What I was doing was sending an Excel spreadsheet to the Human Resources managers of each headquarters and they returned the information that they processed manually. Once with the information in my hands, I had to correct all the content in search of any error, perhaps this was the most tedious part of my work. Once I had the required information ready to put it in a template to order it and graph the results.

Even though this was a short time ago, upon discovering Structured Query Language databases or SQL my perception of databases made me feel like I lived in the paleolithic. This form of database is like a clearly divided and structured map that allows us to make connections between tables to make reports with the information you need. SQL works very well to work with companies information, since it is structured data.

When we talk about SQL we are referring to relational data. All the information is divided by categories and each category is represented by a table with columns. Each table has a Primary Key wich is a unique identifier for a table, this means that it ciuld be something like ID's, phone numbers, etc. The other columns are Foreign Keys, they can be in turn in several tables but their content does not have unique values for that column, nevertheless they serve to pull information from one table to another.

SQL is a very good tool for managing company information, it is very easy to access. Clearly everything is much easier when the information is already stored in a management software and we prevent it from being tampered with.
