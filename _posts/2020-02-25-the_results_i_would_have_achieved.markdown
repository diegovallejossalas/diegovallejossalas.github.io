As I mentioned earlier, I am a psychologist and I worked until a while ago leading the area of ​​talent acquisition in a homecenter in Peru. My job was to work on analysis and always did so without knowing much in depth. At the end of the day the numbers were going well and we aligned ourselves with the indications that came from above.
Today I can see that my understanding of many situations is limited to the quality of the data I had since I did not use statistical methods that would give it more reliability and validity. In addition, the techniques for working the information were also limited.
Many times I think about how Data science could have helped me do my job better then. Definitely my professional growth would have been abysmally more important through the evolution of my work. I would have easily found a solution to many problems about the causes of staff turnover, how to increase commitment and perhaps how to sell the company's brand for recruitment with better profiles and with precise objectives.
Today, I am already thinking how I will do it in my next job.
