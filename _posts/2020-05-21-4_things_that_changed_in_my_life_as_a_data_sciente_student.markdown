**Order**

A few months ago I couldn't have imagined myself with such a neat desk, much less my laptop desktop. Today my head processes everything differently, it needs to understand everything in much greater detail to store it in the right place. It is vital to understand that the worst waste of time is looking for something that we do not know where it is, since this can be perfectly avoidable.
In addition, as we well know, when making our code blocks we must apply the good practice of making it understandable for anybody and leaving comments to easily locate what we are looking for and quickly remember why. If we reinforce this pattern, it is very sure that it will expand to other aspects of our daily life, as it has happened to me.


**Details**

Just like order, attention to small details is a skill that I have developed considerably in recent months, specifically when I did my first project. Is it that before entering the world of code we were so detailed with each letter we wrote? Were we so detailed with the dots, quotes, and symbols that rarely appear? I really don't think so
Nowadays, I can say that to me is more than basic to double ckeck everything.

**Patience**

I always think I'm a gamer, although I am not, but I really like to play FIFA on PS4. Lately I have improved a lot in my results, I have entered into a level that allows me to have good rewards (ok, I will not talk about this anymore). What I want to explain is that I realized that I'm constantly aplying relaxation techniques applied by pro players to stay calm and act patiently when the results are not what expected. This is the big difference between a pro player and an amateur player, they can tell you.

This improvement in my Fifa results was not a coincidence, because I have spent a lot of time making code and trying to solve problems that gave me headaches and over time I have incorporated the pause into my behavior whenever things do not go as I want . Today I can say that I handle it calmly, that I have learned not to despair when I can't find a solution, but above all not to lose my good humor when I do what I like.

Clearly, in a work environment, deliverables require working in the shortest possible time, everyone wants answers and solutions immediately, but without a balance that balances urgency with dedication, it is easy to assume that the result will not be the best.

**Not very friendly conversations**

My conversations on the table are no longer so comfortable for my companions, especially at lunch and dinner time. I always wonder what percentage of what we think we know is true or has some scientific basis and at this point in my life it is inevitable to ask "...and where did you read what you said?", "...do you know how your comment is interpreted according to statistics?". It seems that for many people those conversations on the table are spaces that allow them to comment on anything without fear of being refuted, clearly people are not used to taking what they say in this space as seriously as if they would do it in a meeting in front of their bosses.

Coincidentally, my wife and her family are very religious people, you can imagine how those conversations end.
