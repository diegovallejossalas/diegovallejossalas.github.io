I was always attracted to technology, today much more, since I have a child that will grow digitalized and that will make me closer to the future, in addition to other reasons, clearly.
That attraction in turn drove me away  since everything looked so interesting, wonderful, worthy of geniuses, almost impossible for a common psychologist like me, so far from numbers. That is called fear, psychologically speaking, avoidance.
I decided to take this step despite all my limitations in terms of programming and math knowledge, but that is not my biggest problem. I have been practicing my English for a couple of years, however, despite the fact that I can communicate, studying in English is my biggest challenge and I find myself in need of using technology to understand it.
So how am I going to learn a language (programming) through a language I know fairly? Well, I have to find a way to do it, no matter how but at the same time enjoy that way.
