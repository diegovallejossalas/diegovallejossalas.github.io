There is no need to explain what is happening. We all inform ourselves and listen to those who know more to get an idea of ​​what may happen in the future. Everyone agrees that many things are definitely going to change, and what data scientists (or data science students like me) would be interested in are two things:

What will be my contribution to the community / society / world?

Having the privilege of understanding a language that allows us to get very close to the reality of things, we must put our greatest effort in guiding our work, whatever it is, to what generates some value for others. Can we create any support that helps systems work better in crises? Can we help people have the necessary tools to make good decisions?

New behaviors, new needs, new opportunities:

Each crisis means a new resurgence, and as such, new business opportunities. We need to keep our eyes wide open to try to be the first to understand the need that a new behavior or trend can generate. As I heard around there, crises will provoke the emergence of new entrepreneurs.
