My school education was of poor quality, I always knew it and I didn't care at the time.
My university education was good, I found it difficult to adapt to a study method. Actually, I don't think I ever found a method but I did it anyway.
In recent months I have become convinced that education is a thermometer, it is a chain of tests through which one adapts to situations outside our comfort zone and thus we discover our true potential. Well, until a couple of weeks ago my math potential didn't seem to have any potential.
This totally new situation for me was like trying to understand a Martian language. I felt lost. I repeated the same lesson 3 times and even so, I still had a lot to learn. Thanks to that I discovered that self-learning is the right way. The tools are almost endless and the experiences of other people who suffered at this stage, like me, guide me to continue.
I hope soon to be able to master these topics and explain some concepts so that I can also learn them better.
